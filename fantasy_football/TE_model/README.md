## Project Objective and Description <a name="motivation"></a>
The objective of this project is to use k-means unsupervised learning to cluster similar NFL tight ends together in an attempt to improve fantasy football rookie draft decisions. The model is built using data involving players' NCAA stats and NFL combine data. The features and their descriptions are below:

Feature Description:
* DP: draft pick where player was selected in the NFL draft
* REC_per_GP: receptions per game
* REC_Yards_per_GP: receiving yards per game
* REC_TDs_per_GP: receiving touchdowns per game
* Yards_per_REC: yards gained per receptions
* PPR_per_GP: average fantasy points per game (PPR style scoring) in college
* Combined_REC_MS: a metric designed to represent a player's receiving production in their college offense
* RecPTMPA: receptions per team pass attempt
* REC_Yards_per_TM_PA: receiving yards per team pass attempt
* REC_TDS_per_TM_PA: receiving touchdowns per team pass attempt
* TE_CD: represents the player's percentage of their team's offense in respect to the team's yardage and touchdowns
* TE_BOA: the age in a season a tight end first achieves a greater than 15% receiving dominator rating
* yards_per_rec_over_tm_avg: receiving yards per reception compared to the player's college team performance of receiving yards per reception
* BMI: body mass index (BMI) recorded during the NFL Combine. Formula = Mass (lb) / Height (in)^2 x 703
* forty_time: time it takes a player to complete a sprint measuring 40 yards. Times not recorded at the NFL combine are adjusted by adding .05 seconds to the player time.
* Hand_Size: the distance from the tip of the pinky to the tip of the thumb with the fingers spread out (recorded at NFL combine)
* Arm_Length: the distance from the end of the bicep or shoulder blade to the tip of the middle finger with the arm extended (recorded at NFL combine)
* Power_5_Conference: indicates whether the player played for a school belonging in one of the 'Power 5 Conferences' (Big 10, Big 12, ACC, SEC, or PAC-12) (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* Early_Declare: indicates whether a player declared for the NFL draft before his senior year season (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* Agility Score: a metric intended to measure a player's lateral agility and quickness
* Height Adjusted Speed Score (HaSS): an athleticism metric developed by Shawn Siegele that creates a metric for wide receivers that adjusts a player's 40 time for height.
* Relative Athletic Score (RAS): a metric created by Kent Lee Platte that can easily and intuitively gauge a playerâ€™s athletic abilities relative to the position they play
* Freak Score: an athleticism metric that accounts for the height, weight, and speed of a prospect


## File Description <a name="description"></a>
This paragraph lists the names of all notebook files, their inputs and outputs, as well as what the file does.


**`TE_clustering_public.ipynb`:**
* _Inputs_:
    * `2023_TE_Database.csv`
* _Outputs_: TE_clusters.csv
* _What it does_: This file conducts the k-means clustering analysis on the 2023_TE_Database and outputs player clusters and metrics. This file also generates a .csv file of the results to further analyze in other visualization software.


## Results
* Cluster 1 is by far the best cluster, with 13% of the players averaging 10+ points per game over their first three seasons in the NFL - players that fall in this cluster should be highly considered when drafting tight ends
* Cluster 1 has the highest hit rate for top 5 and top 12 fantasy finishes at the tight end position, with 29.55% of players in the cluster having at least one top 5 scoring season and 63% with a top 12 season
